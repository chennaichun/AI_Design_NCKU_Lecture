"42","Dear Anne, sorry that our restaurant has not fulfilled expectations. Unfortunately we remember your visit, but as we take very seriously all comments, we have analyzed and we feel obliged to make some qualification. All pizzas have the same masses and the same amount, they are all thin crust, ie, the 4 cheese hardly could be very edge or more than others. There are many photos on display by other customers and it is clear that our pizzas are between 1 and 1.5 cm. The ingredients of the pizza 4 cheese (organic tomato, French Emmental, 100x100 goat, ecological Brie and a real Roquefort quality and ecological oregano) should not make it rather bland, but quite the opposite, as they are 4 cheese with personality. For coffee, we have a Swiss coffee brand Jura (in view of diners), that coffee lovers know, which grinds coffee when serving, and throws it automatically, that is, there is never well . The coffee used, we used a large country house, which is the product of 4 grains from different countries, 70% arabica and 30% robusta. Finally, the decor of the room, is a topic of discussion difficult, as it involves subjective personal tastes. We hope that these clarifications will be constructive and invite you to give us another chance, try another pizza or other dish, as well as all the desserts are home preparation. Do not hesitate to tell us any problem at the same time, we will try to resolve it without doubt. Thank you so much","es","5.0"

We ordered a galette (savory pancake) and three pizzas, one author, one four cheeses and a margarita. The three pizzas served us extremely hard, you almost could not split them with a knife !!!, salty and not good taste, use cheese (emmenthal?) Instead of mozzarella, tomato is also tasty.

"85","Dear Customer, Thank you for your opinion. We are pleased that at least the treatment and service have been to his liking and that hath not upset crepe. But we are surprised and disappointed us much their assessment of the pizzas. We seriously thought of his criticism to understand your vision, and to improve or change what is within our reach. We can say in terms of mass is a mass that do more than 30 years ago, the same recipe, carries very little yeast, this makes very little light, obtaining a thin crust. It is not soft but it should not be hard. On the other hand, also over 30 years we opted to use emmental french ago, first because it is mozzarella certified buffalo offerings cow mozzarella currently on the market are in their substitutes most cheese, with large proportions whey, binders, thickeners, additives, aromas and colorants. Our policy is to use natural products as possible, and if they are Bio better. Therefore we opted for a cheese with denomination of origin, we consider soft going very well for our type of pizza. The second reason has to do with the Italian immigration. When Italians have been coming to different parts of the world have adapted pizza to the site of settlement. And in France, the Italians arrive in Marseille, and begins to make pizza with emmental cheese. As my training is French, I have always used this for my cheese pizzas. Finally, we have said several times, the tomato used is natural, ecological and Italian, which just add a pinch of salt and pepper. Probably not come back here, which is understandable, but we advise that in a similar situation, and given that the treatment has been friendly, its time she spoke at the time, and the establishment, you can better understand your appreciation and have the possibility of changing something in that moment.

It is curious decoration with cola ads (Alter Cola) and Catalan beers. As for the food, we tried the pizzas. I wanted one of the so-called copyright (15 €). I found palatable, but nothing exceptional. Maybe the secret is that it puts them all cream, which gives them a juicier texture. My pizza author not ceased to be a mix of original, tasty ingredients, but that does not justify pay 15 € for a pizza ... The desserts, homemade crepes and ice cream, beautifully presented and very rich. In my opinion it is a place that is well, with fair prices (except pizza copyright, which I find too expensive), but not to occupy the No. 1 Andorra restaurants.","es","4.0"

We were not disappointed absolutely nothing. Attention was exquisite and say their dishes. Hot cheese salad with pine syrup vinaigrette took our pizzas palabras.Las more of the same.

"281","I am a pizza lover and the sight of so many positive reviews I wanted to try this famous pizzas. Pizza??? What is the mass, like a pseudo Catalan coke round in shape. The dough is hard and low fermentation. What you get as a topping is not mozzarella cheese and also face !!! In the menu you find a list of pizzas to almost 9 euros and another 15 euros list that define copyright (which are those you would find in any other pizzeria). Im sorry but as pizza is not worth anything. Please give another name! Ahh, otherwise, I was a Saturday night, when in theory you should not miss anything as ingredients to put on pizza. Well, just the 2 pizzas we wanted to order could not serve because we were missing ingredients. The place is tiny, about 7 or 8 tables full of smoke and very easily. We had to keep the door open Local breathing. Only positive note: the attention of local staff.","es","3.0"
"282","Thank you for your review Mr. Simone. We respond to your comment can tell you that currently the two most used internationally masses are: The deep dish, high yeast and very thin crust, with less yeast. The latter is chosen by us, we left to ferment for at least 14 hours. If sometimes missing ingredients, regardless of the day, it is because we work as much as possible with fresh products, we do everything ourselves and the limited space prevents us from having a great stock. Always we deliver the letter to our customers to choose their dishes, and at no time is it written that we use cow mozzarella sticks, which we believe is referred to. The vast majority of our pizzas take as a basis the French Emmentaler cheese and mozzarella we use only in some of our pizzas author, it is the buffalo milk. And in any case we use pre-made, industrial and much less topping sauces, even we are totally against its use. Simply we regret that the pizza was not what I expected.

The second was that we were expecting a large restaurant, and it was small, but a great restaurant. The atmosphere, simple but very comfortable to go in pairs or small groups. And in front of the letter, there were different signature dishes, away from the traditional. After a salad with foie, the crepe was completely different .... with texture, color and flavor out of the ordinary, in doing so, as we explained, with different flours ..... a treat for the palate. The pizza was one of the author .... .... we encaprichamos wearing the pine needles to find a different flavor. The base of the fine and delicious pizza and a whole could tell it was the result of a personal and artisan development, with hours of cooking. For drink, we ordered the sangria spice. Highly recommended for the palate and dangerous for the head, because it consists of different products macerades and spices, very easy to drink and a taste that invited you to repeat. The deal was very nice both by Alejandra in the dining room or in the kitchen Didier. It was the first time we went to dinner and we met seemed time. During dinner, Alejandra was not responding and explaining the composition of dishes, offering at all times being able to change if it was not to our liking. At the end of dinner, and no other customers and we struck up a conversation about culinary fear and was where you could appreciate the professionalism of the couple who greeted us.

Certainly pay 75 euros for 2 menus can not qualify as cheap by any means. Since there is no letter, you do not find the price to the end.

Maybe go with the expectations of being the number 1 on the list Advisor On the positive side, the quality of the products (especially the duck) and the relationship with the price, still without being spectacular, it is more than acceptable. This detracts from what, in my opinion by far the service. It not takes receipt note the commands (drinks) 45 minutes and serve the first course 1 hour and 10 minutes, more so when we talk about a room with 5 tables, 3 with two people and the other 2 5. It is a pity that after two hours of dinner have to get the check after the second, giving up desserts slow. Another thing that is not serious for a catering service today, is the lottery of the account. No letter (the excuse of seasonal products serves me, there whiteboards), and evidently singing dishes, says the price. So to give you the bill, you have to accept what it says. Conclusion: good food, but not worth losing 2 and a half hours having dinner in a room of only 20 square meters. A pity","es","3.0"

It is not just a lunch or dinner, its everything around it becomes a spectacle worthy of the best chefs that notes each for their skin, lives and is completely devoted to his passion which is the gastronomic art. Jordi, we want to thank especially the excellent personal relationship you had with us (three girls and a boy) and give you a big hug. The detail at the end of the dinner was something we appreciate very much because, for us, this finale was ... flavoring and unforgettable !!! Also to thank the two beautiful and nice girls at the table opposite good talk we had as well as participate in great detail. These things make it a stay that does not forget and no doubt future visits to Andorra will always be subject to the Crosto have free table. Greetings to Jordi, Vanessa and by extension, to all the guests with whom we share a night for us to move (voluntarily and involuntarily those responsible diners) one of the best nights and an unforgettable experience but, sure, repeatable.

It is a small restaurant, decorated like a chalet, in a small street where you would not think to find a restaurant, much less of this quality. No map, the boss described, we sing the dishes with passion, precision, and patiently, first the inputs and then the dishes, the guests in all languages. And we choose, without knowing the price of what was asked. Red wine is needed for the dishes. Again, no need to map, we are served a Rioja which satisfies us fully. The dishes arrive quickly. And there, it is a treat, both in terms of presentation than taste. Intoxication of authenticity and inventiveness. 3 different kinds of melons and Hispanic ham, lentil salad, risotto, duck confit with flageolet beans with foie gras, rabbit leg with spinach, beef dish with spicy sauce. Do not miss the desserts, also excellent. During the meal, the boss always takes you further, winning your confidence, trying to excel in the art to satisfy you, and you ended with a tasting of homemade liqueurs, some bases of herbs, Other apple. The timing of the bill arrives. With this royal feast, you think it will be salty, and rightly so. We think back to wine that must cost a fortune. Well not at all, it cost the price of a half bottle of cheap wine in a Parisian bistro. It is the same for the dishes. It is reassured that, were pretty downright surprised.

"585","I can understand that staff traveling to Andorra likes places where time seems to exist. A small house converted into a restaurant. A letter that barely moves for years, and who wanted to continue the guidelines of the old pattern. No objection, but outside because it smells seen. An owner not just to be nice, and pay more attention to who comes to the table to address the noting. A waitress forgot the bread, despite its good intentions for the rest of the meal. And a few dishes without bad taste not become memorable. Only eggs poached with mushrooms and cream become much liked by the whole table. It is clear that we are in a place of trend and French cuisine. hence the wry face of the owner, who should be the one required of anyone who wants to manage a local French one hundred percent. When too customized local, to the address becomes absurdity of their own reality, we can fall into the trap that what should be simple and naturalizad becomes caricature of himself. Wine list with fair prices, but without involving big surprises bottles. Little attention to the environment, both Catalan and French. Flojitos desserts, like a simple routine. Little attention to bread. The service tries to be helpful. And the space is nice, but there is a hint of stale stiffness.

"724","Hello, we were in the last week of 2012 in Andorra. The truth is that after making the stressful shopping streets of Andorra la Vella we lost through the old part of the city and located this restaurant. The truth is we did not expect to find something so welcoming and kind, a revelation. Its a small restaurant run by very friendly family. At all times they were attentive without being intrusive. The food very good indeed, we note that they attach importance to what they serve, as it was all beautifully presented and the quality of the food excellent. For me the fresh pasta with foie gras and mushrooms, and poached eggs with mushroom sauce real good. My kids loved the homemade foie. The house wine (Rioja) more than acceptable for the price I had. Restaurant should be a must see when you go to Andorra. Of course, for us it will be from now on.","es","4.0"
"725","Very good restaurant in the center of Andorra. The owner is very attentive and helpful. The dishes are excellent. Recominedo oysters, oysters au gratin with foie gras, poached eggs with sauteed mushrooms and foie gras, and vegetable pie with mustard. The house specialty is carpaccio of salmon and steak tartare, both certainly excellent. Dessert tart tatin with cream is awesome. Also they make Calvados. Good French red wine. Worth it. We will be back!!!","es","4.0"
"726","It located in a central yet unknown area for people not residing in Andorra, with narrow streets and shops without !. Very attentive and ready to meet the requests of customers. In my case, as my wife does not like oysters, I ordered a half ration with foi, which were excellent. We shared three dishes, smoothly and with all facilities. Highly recommended the rigattoni with foi. The house wine, French, as the owner, very correct and below the botella.Cena ten euros for two with wine, 70-80 euros.","es","4.0"

The restaurant is very pretty and the tables, as opposed to what I read in other reviews, are normal. For food menu consisted of a starter of salad, pâté (both very good), soup and a second choice between cannelloni and steak in the pan, even these very good and cooked to perfection. Although it may seem little enough to fill and you can exit the restaurant beautiful full. The restaurant has a nice selection of wines. Service fast and very friendly. Only negative point, we asked a local wine but they brought a wine produced in the center of Spain, not very good and a bit watery.

"831","We have eaten at this restaurant today, I had booked advising that came with a cart. Upon arrival I asked the waiter if they could leave me a chair to put my 18 months as llevavamos an elevator. It tells us that there are no free chairs ... Well, we should have warned, but it turns out after they arrive guests and not complete tables, chairs superfluous, even when we left, two tables with 10 chairs in total have not been used in all waiter service and has failed to offer them in no time. But this is not important. Fat is what we asked for a menu and another 20 euros 30 euros. I put the pictures. In the 30 euro menu puts aperitiu champagne sangria and then foie gras cappuccino and asparagus with apple sausage. Well, we put directly cheese salad which is the next course. I asked the waitress if there was another dish and says that in the commands have the salad. I put the photo and I can be wrong but I think is a real joke, because if so, better ask me the daily menu of 15 euros. The 20 also makes, or it can sense, yourselves, there is a pica-pica de tapes amb aperitiu prior judge. Well, I have not seen. That if, in the end the girl will take some candy and invite us to a liquor with a pear inside the bottle, which Im sorry, my undrinkable taste. Good food, yes, but might not ask a closed menus 20 and 30 euros (drink apart) and then not all of you out very clearly what is exposed.

"844","I was there with my husband for dinner on a Saturday in May / 15. The Franco-Spanish food restaurant is well set up, the super friendly owner, however, the service is very confusing and pretentious and very poor food. We opted for the 20 euro menu per person, consisting of amuse-bouche, starter, main and dessert. We ordered the smoked salmon tartar entry, which was reasonable. As principal, I ordered a fresh cod, which was reasonable and my husband the grilled filet mignon, which was weak. The accompaniments of both dishes were the same: rustic potatoes and breaded eggplant (both very oily) and salad. To accompany the food we choose a wine Romántica Crianza 2012, we can only take after the opening three bottles whose corks, parched, crashed and would not come out of the bottleneck!

"846","I explain. Small restaurant well located and with a modern and warm decor. We ate a la carte dishes and seemed well presented and with acceptable quality, except the scallops (yes, I know it is foolhardy to ask this in Andorra) they were not, but it was scallops (frozen and badly wrong thawed). I have to say that we dealt with several people and all were extremely friendly and close, but when someone who appeared to be the owner asked us how it was all gone and explained that what was contained in the letter was not what it said, and also I did not like, not only apologized profusely if not that the amount charged me the plate in the account, and not content with that invited us to champagne and chocolates. In this regard 10 their behavior. This does not mean that a restaurant of this level and in which a plate of sea bass (fresh?) Costs 36 € is unacceptable to put paper napkins. And now I will have to talk about the wines. As a fan I am always critical praise or commercial establishments margins apply to wines that: invest, retain, and serve at the right temperature in a cup at the height of the label. In Eximi I ordered the cheaper Albariño they had, the bottle cost € 25.08. It was a wine I did not know, so I searched the internet and online sales worth € 6.70 so I guess in the supermarket will be about 8 €. Judge you. Themselves.","de","4.0"

She only asked us why we had come, we answered that it was because of the good Trip Advisor, and his response was to tell us (no joking) we had interest in doing the same. She also told us not to love the Spanish clientele, although Spanish is not, we believe that this does not happen. Brief will not be returning.

We ordered Gazpacho (being served in a large bowl, generous portion); Artichoke (as made steamed, very tasty), and eggplant stuffed with meat (the latter well presenyadas and fennel added to neutralize the acidity of the tomato sauce ... all very carefully even as a menu) to check that the pass customer is happy and everything goes well, the service attentive and friendly.

The restaurant is in a central area, has few seats and has nice decor. The staff is formal and polite, always present. Lets take a look at the menu and choose one from 29.50 € which includes a flat entry, a main course and a dessert. Drinks not included. As entry is also a plate of 6 oysters (which the menu would be € 10, some poco..strano) but unfortunately ended. I take a plate of foie grais and artichokes. The dish comes with a lot of salad, two pieces of fois grais, 3 cloves of artichokes and two croutons. The artichokes are cool but a bit bland, the fois grais good enough but nothing that. Unfortunately, the fois grais I heard a piece of ice xhe makes me think it was frozen. Main course of a leg of lamb (to what the menu says, cooked for 6 hours). Actually it was very good. Of a sweet cake made from rice pudding with ginger and chocolate pieces. Good. In total with 1 bottle of wine, you have six people spent € 35 each. I gave a vote of three-star not because I got me bad, but because I am not even enjoyed it. Honestly, I had no feeling of a restaurant in which I hope to return soon.

Another thing I like to highlight and others considered as a defect is that the amounts are fair. If you go very hungry I might stay a little short in terms of quantity.

Platin This central restaurant is fairly easy to find at 8 carrer Riberaygua Bonaventura, a little away from the main street, crowded, hot and noisy. The front is very simple and clean interior is very modern but relaxing. Upon entering, while it was 35 degrees outside air conditioning is very significant. The first menu is 15.6 €, dish dessert, and this will be our choice every four, accompanied by a Rioja Rosé. For starters chicken salad, pie zucchini and greens, white beans or soup. The three dishes were well presented and very fresh. For flat it will be salmon, beef tab, and lamb curry. These three dishes were very correct and well prepared, although not too generous especially at the level of the accompaniment (see the photo of the tab beef, meat completely cover the potatoes until soft and it is not there were too ...). The desserts on the other hand were quite satisfactory. The Rioja Rosé without asserting a coast of Provence was quite ok for the price.

In the case of the other diners, the burger was the taste, but in my case was over done for my taste. Besides this, in my case, the burger lacked a bit of joy. It is hoped that a burger that takes at least know mustard sauce, but in this case only tasted meat, which lacked some salt. Regarding potatoes and salad, nothing to fairly normal dishes. The poor quality relative to the price of food adds to the excessive waiting time for serving dishes and uncomfortable method to order / pay.

A little too warm in the late evening. For the rest, it was fantastic and the whole family enjoyed the steak cooked on the grill, the variety of flavors and recipes and the small price. One of the best ways to please the small (and large) by going to a quality fast food.","fr","4.0"

They have a homemade tomato sauce that is tremendous. The house salad is nothing fancy but is pretty good, that if the drinks are a bit price increases than usual. 2 € clear. A few steps from the thermal spa of Chaldean, and if youre lucky like us who were able to book a table for two on the terrace at 9 to go to 10, fine dining.

"1414","We were having dinner one night during the week of Passover (in local Les Escaldes). Situated in a cross from the main shopping street (near the Illa Shopping Centre). We were the first to enter (open at 20:30) but as we go with kids we like to dine soon. They catered soon and assigned a table in the back of the room. They explained how they worked orders. They give you a sheet with different appetizers, burgers, drinks etc they have and you point how much of each you want (there are two sizes of burgers). We ordered more or less classic burgers as there were some with sauces or jams we did not know if we were going to like so better to play it safe (meat, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion and cheese), the only trouble is that they do not ask Why would doneness in meat and when they brought the burgers were quite made (and staying a little dry). The truth is that the burgers are good but if you do not like mixtures and compounds rare sauces and jams have little choice (or choose the most classic), you get a menu of hamburgers at the door if you want to take a look before enter. It did not take much to bring dinner (also not busy, only 3 tables). Price without being expensive but is not cheap (yes, the quality of the burgers is very good), two small burgers, children, a serving of potatoes, water, beer, coke and two desserts were € 40 . The decor is simple, the wall is decorated with cowhide and mirrors, tables follow a straight line, the seats are against the wall are long benches, facing the wall and are chairs. There is not much separation between tables so when busy is just not as comfortable as when we stayed. Up some steps have another tiny flat with few tables (tables are for larger groups). However the service is good, the place is clean and value for money is also good so do not hesitate (even get to try a more sophisticated hamburger, lol)","es","4.0"

As well, we agree with this, because the food was excellent. For starters we ordered some nachos and stuffed with meat and potatoes with cheese on top. The fact that these two dishes were very good, but the burgers were pleasantly surprised. We decided to get the small size, and thank goodness we did because after the starters we were already full. The two burgers we ordered were the Iberian and the Madrid-Barcelona, being different and therefore more good the second. With all this we mean that we highly recommend to future travelers to Andorra to stop at this place for lunch or dinner. To take a catch, only say that no reservations and being served beer straight from the can. Otherwise, everything perfect, and certainly if one day go back to Andorra again.","es","5.0"

Although some details weakens and makes water mainly by the poor quality of its staff. If we focus on the food enough to say they offer a menu composed of an assortment of burgers at all palatable combinations. The meat is of Andorra theory itself and although that may not testify if I can say that it was tasty and juicy. The only thing against the bread would be used to close the sandwich, it was too gummy and unfortunately detracted from the rest of the dish. If we speak now of the service have you seen that episode of the Simpsons where they go to an Italian where the staff speaks as if customers could not hear them? Because here the same. Or they think it will not hear (unlikely) or directly do not care. In any case; a meal there given the opportunity to hear and discuss your waiters and kitchen asked loudly or as pure cry discussed variety of topics. My favorite was when they began to discuss how to make coca stripes with a credit card. Luckily in charge account only food and drink. The show is free.

The place is beautiful, decorated with avant-garde style with two floors. We went upstairs, looking more comfortable than down where tables are lined up in an area too much foot traffic and waiters. Upstairs is an area with about 6 tables and the atmosphere is calmer. The burgers are 100% beef, although the variety of the menu is a bit sparse. Important that you ask the crush you a little, as they are very fat, but remain poorly made. Each burger has several combinations of cheeses, salads, fruits, sauces, bacon, mushrooms ... In the end we chose most of the house, full of character and very tasty. We also call for the center nachos and some fries with chili. The nachos seemed pretty normal, Ive eaten better, but the potatoes, served in a clay pot, were very good. A tiny brownie dessert which, for our taste, it lacked a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the cake quedase not so dry. We dined well, relaxed, comfortable, quick service, ... but I did not feel as cheap as I read, and so different. Maybe the good reviews read increased my expectations.

For starters, the variety of burgers is somewhat limited, as both combinations of ingredients. We opted for the day which had mozzarella- and goat cheese. As starters we ordered some nachos with guacamole and cheese were well-more doritos- and some potatoes with aioli -correctas apple, which we liked our menu-. Then came the burgers and there was the drama: a point of firing past the dense became something to chew, taste-they had killed him the desire to notice the peculiarities of veal andorrana- and condemn finished lunch. The bread did not help to save the situation, too much for my taste crumb, very industrial, in the end I had to become a llesca and wet in the rest of the apple aioli baked potatoes. And the accompaniment without the presence of chips -sustituidas for mesclun lettuce and potato half caliu- I found a mistake. The local (nearest to Pyrinees) is small but cozy, has a good heated terrace and offers friendly and efficient service. From my point of view, they should ask for doneness you want the client to consider as an option to choose what you want for your burger accompaniment.

So if you are hungry you will receive a mini slap every forty minutes and looks that the restaurant was not crowded.

The preparation is the best Ive had so far, has some dishes that just Degusto when there will, I will only mention the salad Xicória which is DELICIOUS, was the 2nd time I ate the first harvest of the year. The other dishes, whatever they may be, may want will be delighted, its all GREAT. The somillos of buey could not be more to my liking. Everything from starters, tapas, Pinxos, cold / hot dishes, desserts, new wines (crianza) and old, a letter of very great quality. Reservation required, and what the problem is, it costs nothing and is well worth the time to be expected is irrelevant, it does not happen by the time between the various dishes that are chosen, because the atmosphere and service, surpass anything that.

The decor is simple in terms of quantity or greatness, are details, many children, with great charm, Rudolph, the rocket of Tintin, Mickey Mouse and many smaller decorative details. But the palm of detail is definitely regarding the dishes and others, plates, fountains, glasses, tablecloths, breadbasket, all this attention to detail, with care, with dedication, taste and very functional way, with a certain vintage. Come up with the best of restaurant service. We attended a charming Portuguese girl, sang dishes, suggestions and prices with harmony as Ive ever seen. Your service was excellent, attentive at all times without being annoying and she never enough to meet all local. Food. The idea is to share tapas. We started with an appetizer of Italian bread sticks with oil and Toledo dried tomato and papaya salt, Easy? as it turned out great and funny. After bread with tomato and oil. Again, excellent. Ravioli of the day, chicken Bages, with fresh mushrooms and gravy. I would not like, I do not like stews, actually, and to me was that, a stew. However, my wife, she was the best dish of the night. He took his cap and half of mine! Scrambled eggs with truffles. We read some reviews here that were the best we had tasted was not our case, buenisimas presentation and quality, with slight smoky aroma, the end plate not convince us too. Small beef burger. Estupendísimas straw potatoes and Dijon mustard best Ive ever had. The good though somewhat dry meat on toast and mixed greens. Here I mean the price (7.5 euros), because if we thought excessive. Very good coffee and tea in a nice cup. No wine since we did on food, but the menu seemed very appropriate, although very high price. for example, recently I took Lopez Cristobal de Ribera del Duero (Foster) for 18 euros a bottle, so a cup 5 euros seemed very high.

"1791","The restaurant, in the Pyrénées Shopping Centre in the center of Andorra la Vella, offers a buffet at quality control. For 16 euros per person, including drinks (coffee, but without alcohol included), you will have access to a buffet decorated with fresh, regularly renewed. The buffet does not deserve the label luxury on the pretext that there foie gras and shrimp, but has good products. The organization of the buffet did not follow any particular logic and there were not a lot of cheese. However, plenty of choices, and the fact (that is rare) to also have unlimited drinks seduced us. The price is reasonable, the value as well. This must be done at least once.

We arrived about 14:15 pm at the entrance there was a bit of a queue of people waiting, but only took about 15 minutes to get in. As for the food, because the variety is not bad for quality and pretty good for a buffet, the very best Ive seen. There is a bit of everything, to salads, no sushi, cheeses, foie gras, sausages, hot foods (paella, veal with mushrooms, macaroni, etc ...), there is a grill area where they make prawns, razor clams, meat, sausages, which are very good. There are two areas where the desserts, one refrigerated and the other hand is a chocolate fountain and enough variety of fruits for use with the chocolate fountain. The drink is included in the price and you can repeat as many times as you want. From soft drinks, beer, wine, cava, sangria and water. (There are a few water sources within these carafe).

"2048","A local nice, located in the old quarter of Andorra la Vella, could give the impression that whats inside is just as careful. But the trouble with fashion is that rather than stopping to exalt the authentic rather be fast and tiptoe around the truth. Andorra is not Barcelona or San Sebastián, so offer a menu where seafood dishes even those who provide meat, it is disappointing. Neither the daily market, medium quality, and professional distribution, make offers sea may have the desired quality. The humility of a gift that entrepreneurs and cooks should exercise. They save a lot disgust. So you have to look at what you have around and make the party that can offer. And above all, try things that house one offers. From the appetizer it is clear that things will not go well. A mushroom omelette, like a pancake, dry. A very lively enough broth to add personality to the proposal. The right steak tartar, octopus coca boasts smoked in his statement but not evident on the plate. The mushroom risotto without contrast, although it could be the highlight dish of the night, always is there to eat the same taste throughout the development of a dish? Should not we find the sápida emotion through contrasting textures and products? The San Pedro, frozen and dry, surrounded by certain vegetables, carrots which have lost their fragrance and are blackened in part, accompanied by a muslin low taste and sparingly. Disjointed dish that mimics but does not reach the aesthetic concept. Boneless pork feet and stuffed meet and show that you can work with interesting results humble. A painted cannelloni, dry, compact and devoid of personality closes dinner. Service does not connect to the table, despite not having the restaurant a table more than two people. What evil has made many entrepreneurs cooks believe that aesthetics is the ethics that should guide their premises. Wine list with fair prices but with little attention to what happens around these territories. Im still surprised to meet so far letters where wines are offered, not because they have quality and interest, but every country deserves extreme attention to try to find products that can better talk about its features.","es","3.0"

The result, regrettably, much was another disappointment. The direction taken and the desire of the team to be a good restaurant is right and encourage them to continue to evolve but no details of the basis difficult to correct. For starters, lighting and acoustics of the local it has not been sufficiently studied to be really hard to hear your companion when the home is complete. And the lighting in the room does not give a sense of intimacy in the table, quite the contrary. A highlight of the restaurant is the bathroom, with details and a second to none with any Michelin star. Good food, nothing more. Little letter. Bodega insufficient. I hope to evolve positively as I possibly bring me back a nice surprise.","es","3.0"

"2066","We spotted this little restaurant for a few months and we finally tested attracted positive ratings. Overall, the experience was very pleasant. It must first acknowledge this type of cuisine (one is gastronomic) in Andorra where the kitchen is usually either very or very average tapas / grill. The dishes (appetizers, entrees and desserts) are rather well executed and very fresh ingredients (for example, it tells you though its a good 20 minutes before having your risotto: minute preparation time). I think the chef must still young and his kitchen still needs to be refined (but promising). The service is mixed: the server is not bad in itself and it certainly tries to do its job properly.

Reading the letter we could recognize several classic dishes of Andorran cuisine, how different was his presentation and finishing the dishes. It was felt in all the dishes work hours in the design of each and every one of the dishes to visually mouth and especially in the end was completely harmonious and delicious. A good wine list to pair. And as a final note ristreto good coffee. Back for sure, recommend 100%","es","5.0"

"2072","We went to this restaurant because of the good reviews it had on trip. The place is very nice, with many details (hangers made of cutlery, handles made of keys, special cutlery, and etc.), including the bathroom, which is rather curious. It has a spacious living room, fireplace and glass so you can see the top of the kitchen. There are only six tables so I think you better book (although we went for lunch on a weekday, without having booked, so no problem). The restaurant will have two chefs, a girl and a boy, too young to go in the right direction but they still have a bit of shooting. For example, I did not like that they did not have the card exposed outside, walked blindly, by relying fully on the TripAdvisor reviews. This is a mistake, because I believe that in this way you can lose customers who do not dare to enter itself is very expensive. We entered and waited a rather unprofessional Andalusian waiter. We handed the letter, which was in Catalan, but was not able to translate the dishes or specify us along the service what each should take. We kindly translated the letter the father of the chef, who sat eating at the next table with his wife and another man. This is another detail that should be corrected: have letters in other languages, not only in Catalan. The menu is not extensive, as I like (but few dishes to shine in all, no matter what you order) with 9 starters, seven meats, fish and May 5 desserts. We asked the waiter if there was possibility to ask for a tasting to try a little of everything, although the menu does not contemplase menu. He went to consult and left twice, each person told us something different (for 55 euros / two first, two seconds and two desserts per head 55 € / person a first, second and dessert, drink apart in both cases). I think I did not hear well what I told the cooks, and is worse than leaving the menu with a dish per person to ask for a letter. This issue would have liked to speak directly with one of the chefs but did not go to the room (although there were only three tables occupied and three people in the kitchen). In the end we decided to ask for a letter. We wanted to first ask Foie mi-cuit and Artichokes with foie, but it turns out they had run out the foie. So we opted for cannelloni tomatoes and llamantol (lobster), but neither possessed lobster so in the end we chose Steak tartare and risotto Guatlla (quail). A bad sign that no three of the nine starters. The waiter said the risotto did at the time so take 20 minutes so we first serve steak tartare, very good sign. From welcome aperitif were put eggplant cream with a slice of apple crisp and sprouts (the waiter failed to tell us why); very good, it was clear that the broth which was prepared was very tasty steak tartare was good but lacked the classic egg yolk (and if they did they put it in the kitchen).. He came presented on a slate plate with balls of fried potato and crispy who did not know the waiter what they were. It was all rich. From here we decided not to ask more waiter and intuit the ingredients, because not told us what had the dish when served and had to go to the kitchen all the time to investigate it, hindering service. That shows a lack of interest or the waiter, who does not know what is serving, or lack of orders from the cooks, who have to ensure that the waiter does his job well (or perhaps both ...). Then came the quail risotto, plentiful, absolutely delicious and at the right point. Here they had very nice touch, because as it was handed out to share two ration and they put a plate on each. Second and the waiter told us there were no scallops therefore could not order one of five fish dishes. In the end we decided on Trio dAnas to grapefruit / Trio of duck with orange which included foie gras, confit and magret, I venture to say, with an orange sauce rich and not crumble I know very well what, and I did not dare to ask. This dish was delicious, the one I liked all. I must say it works fine duck. Its a shame that the waiter did not explain us more about the working of it. Besides the plate that was served came cocada, like almost all we saw, a nice touch. We also ask Tournedos de bou / verduretes ox, which came served on a slate plate. The meat was exquisite and delicious vegetables, just right. For dessert we ordered amb orelletes Andorran Cream which is like the Catalan cream Galician ears. He came served in a tiny Ollia, an original presentation. It was delicious but came cold cream, which was a bit strange mixture with hot caramelized above (I would warm but perhaps this is a pet peeve of mine). We also tried pa amb Xocolata, salt i oli wearing toast, creamy and rich chocolate spheres of oil (assuming it was cornicabra but the waiter had no idea nor was asking). The spheres told us that they did not, a shame but I guess it will be more cumbersome. The dish was very good, a great combination of ingredients. When we were with the desserts and cooks left but were stopped by our table, which was the only one still occupied, the rest was gone, not even to ask if we had enjoyed everything. They took a coffee at the bar and left with a simple goodbye. The chef comes to the table is a detail that I like to have in this type of restaurants and I think you can learn a lot as long as the criticism is constructive, that is. I think it is not simply shyness approached. As for the wine list with over 35 references but it seems that prices are greatly exaggerated (and even more when in Andorra alcohol is much less rates in Spain and France). We would have liked to try an Andorran wine but we were not willing to risk paying 40-50 euros per bottle. In the end we decided on a pink cava of Juve i Camps perfectly accompanied the meal, for 19 €. We paid 95 euros for all (to cafes were invited, nice gesture, becoming less common in hotels), which seems to me a good price given the job of dishes. However I give a thumbs down to the service, in a place like this you can not afford to treat you the waiter colleague flatware serve in any way, or do not know what is in the letter or which carry the same . Its a shame because the food is good and, although it remains to iron out some things, I think going in the right direction, chefs are very young, with a lot of projection and professionals, opposite the service, which was harmful and detracts kitchen work.","es","4.0"

We were in the room with green walls, the tables are repeated and some is tradition, but to me it seemed dull and redundant. -Menu: We have not seen any typical Andorran dish, that is, of those who offer themselves as star dishes on the edges, for example (soups, stews of chup-chup, small game ...). Here is the repertoire of Mediterranean and Castilian cuisine. -Production: Ordered lamb chops in a traditional version does not have more secret, only they need to be juicy, which is not found. And pigs feet that were not to throw rockets. First it was something of garlic, I do not even remember what it was, because only the parsley and garlic Desserts felt ... like we have the last century)) and tradition can serve more elegantly. -Price: We found excessive pay for these mediocre dishes an average of almost € 60 per head.

Very rich, both the tournedos with truffle sauce and the steak with sherry sauce and shavings of ham. What I was really disappointed, I am considering we paid 27 euros for a plate, is that this is not a complete, perfect dish in full. Lining with any of the dishes, either meat or fish, a paste was a potato ... swimming in oil. More exactly, it had the consistency of a paste, without being mashed, but the appearance was that of the remains of potatoes that are stuck to the tray after doing the baking potatoes and scratches with one spoon. As for the taste, was the potato which was frozen before reaching the kitchen, potatoes that a little sweet, but because its bad as raw material, not because it is the American sweet potato variety.

"2307","We went this last night, I, a friend and her daughter. I can not say its a bad place but what really surprised me regular meeting and the opinions of people who say its so good, because really no big deal. I am a big fan of pizza and my friend ordered a pizza Hawaii. I tried it and it was sooo average, to say otherwise. I have tried many and does not kill. It was very large, yes and cheap, because it was worth 8.50 euros. Only order pizza and dinners but not a great quality pizza. I ordered a provolone first and itself was very good. Normal bread. Second I ordered chicken fillets. In the letter just put chicken fillets, so I asked how it quería.Pregunté what could be and the lady told me that normally served with baked potato and said perfect. When I had brought enough vegetables and some sort of potato cake with carrot. It was not bad but it was not what I had imagined. If I say baked potatoes, I guess baked potatoes, not a lot of vegetables with a potato cake and vegetables. For dessert I ordered a glass of ice and was also very good. It is not a negative review but if someone looking for quality over quantity this is not the right place.

Requesting the table was reserved for 4 people carrying out waiting 20 minutes, while you you were given a table right away. I was a first time said sorry not to give that table, because it was a table of 4 and ye were 2 and yet you returned to insist with the other waitress to see if there was luckier. For this reason I will say again that it could not be possible, how can that not be the best possible and for this reason they apologize.

At 13:00, we return so welcome equally indifferent, we understand that this is because we had a voucher for this restaurant namely a main course and dessert offered for a main course and dessert acheté.Nous therefore order a dish and, the boss forces us to take an entry because it does provide that the entry and dessert despite récipicé the voucher. We bent his application so as not to make waves in the establishment and so we ordered a starter, main course, dessert, a bottle of wine: The charter was not respected.

"2378","My wife and I were victims of the horrendous food from their lunch menu and its poor customer treatment. The menu is well hidden but put 9.95 plus tax, 4.50. The terrace well, we sat down, we bring the letter of the menu and are surprised a French waitress about 50 years I was picking a table with a bucket pulls the liquid contents of the bucket into the street, she says to refresh .I have 43 years and in my travels throughout Europe I have never seen a more vulgar. He speaks Castilian that is barely understands Topic meal my wife ordered a mixed salad, even mixed look of the salad, all green, with little tomato, half boiled egg and some shredded carrots in minimum amount. I ordered cannelloni, dry pasta, with little sauce and pieces that seemed more nervous than meat inside, let that not a dog eats. The two ordered chicken with pepper sauce, although the chicken was grilled chicken breast cut into pieces and had put some kind of sauce with peppercorns and black, as always put green pepper, results in a revolting sauce. We not ordered dessert and although the menu came as a drink wine and water for each ordered wine and soda. The gas was small and no brand and going to charge us 2.40 euros paid 4.5 percent more for the gas tax, I mention the French waitress who I think is the owner very rude and tells me I ordered wine, I say go and have the nerve to tell me that the gas does not come when I have not asked for water bottles that have touched me or order desserts, other sites for customer loyalty not you throw a stick of 2.40 euros plus tax and change you two bottles of water by a gas of equal value. And the good thing was already in the hotel we started to feel stomach problems followed good diarrhea. Each breakfast different things so very clearly was the crappy food restaurant Primavera, if I get to be in Spain I denounce health. You know if you have problems with constipation eat restaurant in the spring of Andorra la Vella, to stay with good clean guts.","es","1.0"
"2379","Hello, We thank you for sharing your opinion but we gutaria clarify certain points. 1. The mixed salad from our menu at € 9.90 is up to the price, if he wanted a fuller, he has taken a salad from our menu, which are many and varied, such as salad sea and mountains, seafood and foie gras, or another example, goat cheese salad with bacon, walnuts and honey. I can also mention the spring salad, more classical, more perhaps of his style, with tuna and asparagus among other ingredients. 2. In relation to the chicken breast, tell that never deceive our client and that is what this menconado in the menu, namely: chicken breast with pepper sauce I mean I do not understand your surprise. 3. In relation to the 4.50% applied, if he had informed a little, would know that from the 01/01/2013, Andorra has imposed a new tax called IGI (for the Spanish VAT) which is 4 percent, 5% for both Primavera Pizzeria to all the restaurants and shops of Andorra. 4. I find it very easy to relate his diarrhea with our food, considering it could have been caused by other circumstances: water from another country, altitude, any other food or beverage ingested it could have caused. We also inform customers eating at Pizzeria Primavera every day of the week and for several years, and have never received any complaints from them. 5. Regarding the tray sprinkled the ground on arrival, sorry lot. But specifically tell the French lady takes dirijiendo the restaurant for over 30 years and we feel we have not been able to understand his Spanish, knowing that if he wanted, he would have attended in English, French and Russian perfectly.

Near the center I found this pizzeria and chose it because it offered a very affordable lunch menu with a cozy terrace respect other restaurants around. They surprised the dishes as they put plenty of food and fresh. For example, I ordered the salad with goat cheese, rich and huge with crispy cheese with honey and nuts, and a pizza ... my mother! I had never tasted a pizza crust so thin and keep straight, you could tell it was handmade dough. My partner tried a kebab (I think, how pedes ask a kebab in a pizzeria ...?) As amazing. I can assure you it is the best kebab Ive ever tasted !! In the terrace it was luxurious, with a decor that blends the familiar with modern touches, such as colors or lamps made with strainers! Attention, very good. We saw (in case you used the data) that deliver at home, which is fine. Overall, I was thrilled to have eaten in Andorra so much, so well and for so little.

The tacos: were wrong and brought others, because of course we requested the barbarity of three, but probably had distracted them Mariachi singing. By the way, put 4 pieces of bad meat stalls, a few pieces of pineapple and what already is? Without sauce so dry? For my taste the food lacks imagination and some art to cook. Yes, the atmosphere is achieved, both the decor and of course Mariachi, at least it encouraged a little thing, maybe too much, because I thought I was paying (and not just pleasing to the pocket) for dinner, not for Bellows.

The guacamole is just right, excellent quesadillas, as well as the rest of the entrees weve tried. Corn tortillas seem very good to have been made outside Mexico. The deal is very nice.

It really is a beautifully restored authentic Andorran Borda, who manages to convey the warmth of these venerable buildings. We were welcomed with a generous appetizer. When ordering, as good urgellencs we are, we opted for the house specialties. I ordered a trinxat with rostes and my wife chose the mashed with foie. I assure you that of rostes, it has nothing to envy the fact that my grandmother has a lifetime. Mashed cabbage, trumfo (potatoes) and good cuts rosta. The foie gras, so I wanted to try, but my wife did not give me the chance ... Second-we opted for the meat. We had spoken highly of the Andorran llosa beef tenderloin and it asked. Exquisite.

I just got back from dinner at La Borda, and I think there has been a radical change in the customer, probably forced by the times and the crisis, now you serve and pamper you. The food, always typical mountain is very good, mainly meat and sausages. If you are lucky enough to go in February, which is the time of spring onions, and prepare them with this incomparable romesco sauce, then check one of the culinary delights not sufficiently valued in our country.

Also the tables are widely spaced, so you have plenty of privacy. The treatment is correct. They are for you but not overwhelm you and can recommend a wine to accompany the meal with great discretion. We say let us advise and foie propueta was the home port, prepared by themselves. I tasted foie in many different places and this is one of the best I have tasted, simply Exquisite !!! My wife ordered a cinnamon mushrooms with a touch of foie and were also excellent !!! For the main course I ordered a beef tenderloin and seared my wife a sirloin of deer. Tenderloin great, very tender and tasty with little blood beef, and venison tenderloin also excellent. In congratulating the maitre about the quality of meat we struck up a conversation and explained to ripen fillets for several weeks in the cold chamber so that the meat is more tender, tasty and not bleed. It is how you should do but not all restauarntes do so. The wine we make, payment Carraovejas and found it very acceptable price on the 30 € bottle about. The desserts are good, also homemade. We were invited to a glass of champagne. The price we paid was high, about 120 €, but considering the dishes and the wine we ordered reasonably encounter.

As a second course we confit of duck with apple, which in my partner was bland, bland, poorly designed, and the truth it was so ... so we have taken in far more modest best restaurants ... and also I took duck, filleting grilled, it is theoretically one of the house specialties, the grilled meat was too burned out, and very little done inside (I ordered meat to the point), for my taste was more oil to the point. .. it tasted right. I have taken infinitely better at other restaurants in Andorra. For dessert, they bring you a mega-dessert trolley which is very nice because you see directly what you drink, we ordered a tiramisu and really ... pretty bad. Not worth the price or your service ... very expendable dessert. We accompanied the meal with a beer and water. The price was € 35 per person, a real nonsense for what we make.

It is a very nice restaurant located right on the river that separates Escaldes Andorra. The views and superior dining decor are beautiful and very welcoming. Attention. I remember the last time you better. This time, the waiters were in a mess. Lots of waiters pacing and error in the service. To me it was not me, but I know people who told him it was not a restaurant to go with kids. Before menu did not, so I guess things change ... Food. Both in a letter last time (we ate fondee cheese and meat Llosa still remember). As it is, with a menu with correct portions and a terrific product for the price.

"3441","Walking through the center of Andorra La Vella we stumbled upon this restaurant, which looks out really nice and well located. We split: As good regular at Tripadvisor, I read some reviews previously reported, the truth is that at first I pulled back the fact that everyone was complaining about the service and value for money. Well said you my experience: I entered the restaurant with my partner with flashing alarms, trying to foresee any hint of arrogance by the service and the fact that you waived things like covered, bread and olives that They serve without warning (that I have sacadl of prior reviews). We were asked if we wanted menu or letter to letter what we choose as we wanted to try the steak on the stone they do. We attended two waitresses, very nice and pleasant, one of which recommended we ordered the beef tenderloin instead of duck meat, beef and turkey. We listened, and also ordered a beef steak tartar and drink to share a lambrusco. The steak tartar, sublime, and that we tested real good French steaks, but this was not far behind. They brought the iron in meat is done and a sirloin steak that looked great (attached photos) and, as expected, were delicious, served with Roquefort sauce, pepper and foie (you get two to choose , the other ordered separately). We were satisfied and ordered a dessert to share also great (attached photo). Highlight the friendliness of the waitress who greeted us and thank you for the recommendation. Issue price, I commented: if you go to lunch, you have a menu for 15 euros which is fine. The letter is expensive, but worth it (at least what we ask us) if you want to give them a caprichillo (attached photo). At night, the menu up to 20 €. In short, great atmosphere, great setting, service very good (I must say that all the bad reviews about the service are aimed at waiters, maybe we were lucky that we touched the girls) and (very good also the lambrusco) excellent food .

The restaurant has two spacious rooms decorated with taste (in the ground floor and first floor) that allow quiet dinner without being assaulted by converasciones or smells of the nearby tables. As for the food it is worth noting the reclettes and foundees that are the stars of the premises and offered in a variety of cheeses and accompaniments. Although it is a bit heavy menu (especially for dinner) the quality of the raw material makes it not a greasy experience (as it does in other places). It is therefore a good opportunity to taste a food that otherwise is not very common in the cuisine of the Peninsula. Although not disproportionately expensive it certainly is not no bargain and not noted for an outstanding price / quality ratio.

"3606","We went to lunch a group of 5. Just come in and gave me a bad feeling, they treated us as if we asked alms because they have no reservation. If you have no free tables we go to another restaurant, do not suffer, you would not have had such a bad experience! The meat ration was 450 grams stone and my sister and I decided to share a platter and order a salad for two because we were not hungry. The letter indicated that only we could order that dish if you solicitabas least two servings, so my boy decided ordered a platter for himself. The other two people also decided ordered a platter for sharing. When the waiter arrived I asked three servings of meat. The man did not understand and said a ration for two of them, one for my boy and for me and my sister. The man said, then five servings! I repeated that I did not want five but only wanted three. The man began to treat me silly pointing fingers than the minimum was two portions and that can order a serving, two, three, four or five ... you understand? Of course I understand, I replied. And we want three servings. Then you have not understood, he said angrily. My friend got it wrong and tried to explain that I could order two servings and three also. Exactly, I said to my friend And we want 3. The angry man shouted saying You do not understand! I was amazed because it has never happened to me in a restaurant and go about three times a month, so I told him that pointed what he wanted. When they are going to go I said, then we will bring a ration for each? And we were charged 20 euros each? When I told him I want a share of 20 euros to share with my sister. The man breathed and said: You have told me they wanted 5 servings, because if you want 3 then three but you agreed. I had a hard time, I never go back to that restaurant! I also believe that the ration was not 450 grams, was very small, they charge 20 euros to bring you the raw and you have to fry you on the table. Accompanying came with potatoes and only brought two bowls for three servings. We had to wait over 20 minutes to be brought up the account and charge you € 1.50 per person per covered should be a mandatory gratuity. For me it is believed that they have very being one of the best restaurants, as only negatives I found him. Also we ordered a salad with goat cheese and spaghetti and had a lot to improve. The only good? Beside the restaurant is a creperie in which they very cheap and delicious crepes! No I recommend it to anyone!","es","4.0"

For dessert we stay on chocolate fondue and there ... CATA! 10 fruits for 2! Charged € 12. Unacceptable.

A smell if he wants one of his dishes is the cheese fondue? There are people who complain for complaining. I went 2 times to this restaurant and I am not in agreement. On the first visit we ate a salad and a cheese fondue. We told the waiter we wanted to try some meat. The desanconsejó us if we asked the fondue, because it would be a large amount of food. Elsewhere we would have been likely to have knowingly targeted the flesh us could not eat. On the second visit, a little stone meat, sauces and some potatoes. For dessert, a chocolate fondue with fruit. I must say that is a little expensive, but the quality of the meat is what you have. With the price of dessert if Im not agree, because it remains fused with seasonal fruit chocolate, and other force you to order a fondue for 2.

As for the quality I can assure you that raclette cheese is the best there is in the market because it comes originally from Savoy and raw milk, and sausage that I can tell you ... the iberico savor is not the same as the normal sausage, so the people who are not accustomed to savor it can locate an iberico strong flavor.

In one of the many occasions when we traveled to Andorra, we decided to look online to see if we could find a restaurant to eat. When discovered El Refugi Alpi raclette and those that had looked so good, we went there. When we arrived, and decided to ask for a raclette, we were weighing the different varieties, so we decided on a real Raclette, which is composed of the famous raclette, an assortment of cold cuts (high quality) and a bowl of potato cooked with skin (cachelos style). The presentation of the raclette accompaniments and was most curious and immediately invited a bite. The treatment was successful and staff at all times were watching us. The taste of raclette, excellent! To say that we also ordered seconds as the raclette was four, but after this experience, I would say that with the raclette is more than enough. Second, we ask: Ravioli fresh pasta stuffed with shrimp and scallops (tasty), Feet of grilled pork (which according commented were very good and plentiful), and costilletas of grilled lamb (which also had very good review ). For dessert, and if all this were not enough, we dared with a chocolate fondue was outstanding.","es","5.0"

The plate was made of stone and was scaladata electrically. Together they brought 3 different types of sauces, a garlic, a pepper and a mushroom in addition to a potato flan. We liked the idea a lot of the meat cook us as blood volume, more or less rare, and gradually it was needed so as to have more hot food. Cost of the dish 20 € per head, for the amount Id say it adeuguato price.

No sooner had we ordered, olives were already there as a starter. For the main course we had chosen an assortment of meat. We were brought a warm stone on which we were able to grill the raw meat itself. We thought that was quite funny - and actually its also a good idea to decide for yourself whether you want the meat rather bloody or rather through. Whether the price of 40 € for a mountain of meat but was (in pairs) appropriately, is questionable. The desserts cost about 6 euros. The ambiance is nice friendly with a view of the shopping area, the staff. Not all spoke English, but we could make ourselves understood.

It is also true that it is a clean and a neat appearance (with no Vietnamese atmosphere), but rather the food that is most important in a restaurant is really bad, never recommend it to anyone. The dishes are basic and unbalanced. Eye wear any rice dish, it is a mountain of rice and a little of everything, and when I say a little is really very little. The dishes were brought in a disorderly manner and in any case incomplete The value is dire, you feel cheated.

"4326","For a birthday dinner with family or were looking for a fine restaurant. We are tempted by the map and frame. We already knew the hotel we enjoyed. Arrived around 21h reservation, we waited half an hour for the command. We ordered some tapas as an aperitif but they finally arrived at the end of 1h30 with the entries. The fried calamari are neither too fat, too salty or very good, and the average kibble. The servers are very nice but the wait is too long. Attention here they call langoustines, are none other than prawns. The dishes are very uneven and the whole map is not available. Cod is good but this terrible lack of support. Cod with green asparagus was accompanied by 10 small unhappy weight dueled and poached egg and fried Bacon was very dry with frozen chips. Let us not forget the entry salad with Brie de Meaux melted, almost € 15 for 2 toast with 2 slices forming barely warm, this is an expensive kilo of forming. As for desserts, the choice is limited: apple pie, chocolate cake or chocolate cake and a raspberry and chocolate sponge cake, we have finally chosen.

As for the pasta, we asked for our daughter bolognese bows nor was wonderful (although it was not bad).

We arrived at 21:30 and the first dishes, 2 basic lettuce and tuna salad we could not pick and they were to share and 2 Cokes tomato. Came to the table at 22:45, the tables were arriving after us were served before. Well, we had patience as we were not coming birthday and we expected a little more. The latter were to choose, which is our surprise when the waitress start saying that certain burgers and pizzas could not be entered because they do not choose our menu, which was not reported when we hired him. So we talked to the manager and fixed because it played no choice but finally we were able to order what we wanted as put in our (so that it had on paper) closed menu. At the end, while we were with desserts, and were the only guests of the room (as all were served before us), began mopping the floor, with the door open in the middle of snow, inviting so unpleasant to leave the restaurant. It is the first time it happens. I think a lack of education on their part, of course not be recommending they go groups, and if they are going to be well informed of what they put on the menu to avoid surprises, slow service, the staff was not formed, the poor waitress I did not hear anything, whenever you wondering whatever you ask him to wait for another partner or responsible since she did not know (at least the girl was nice).

"4631","For a day visit to Andorra, we made the unfortunate decision to eat at the restaurant Tall Taula. My partner ordered grilled salmon, and I stress grilled and I decided to take a beef soup with rice, so find me a delicate stomach, something that I informed the waiter. To our surprise, dry salmon, which they had sold as quality, came integrated into a pool of refined cooking oil, which turned out to be completely indigestible. Not to mention the accompanying an overheated wire fried onion with a batter and fried mashed integrated into a beautiful clamshell. Let FRITANGA pure and simple! About my soup, they brought a tiny bowl with a layer of oil floating and aguoso broth, when I tried it, I knew completely garlic. Then, I called the waiter to inform him of the situation and told me that it was the fat from the broth. Can we laugh of me trying or he had not seen a broth in your life? Fat meat broth melts when heated. The waiter took the plate and informed me that they had fried rice with garlic before mixing with another batch of broth FRITANGA! these people can not for frying everything. Finally, I decided to order a grilled hake, which was in the same state as salmon, lousy. Best of all was when we asked the account. Remarkably, the letter puts the price of fish per 100g, logically if it is running, the waiter should ask the client how many grams you want to take. Well, that was not our case, they decided that I would take 400g of hake almost half kilo by 21,35 euros, or joke that amount was on my plate, and my mate 250g salmon 14 euros. Crazy, promptly we called the waiter and asked the manager to come. After a long conversation, in which I try to offend inviting us to go to the corner bar with plastic chairs in which we would find a better price to our liking, we lowered the price $ 10, coincidentally the cost of the soup . I repeat the same thing, I have no problem paying but do not want anyone to decide for me how much you want to take and how much Im willing or can afford. If that is the case, put the price of the dish.","es","1.0"

Im not going to be picky about this, it can happen everywhere, but better to be prepared and have more menus in other languages at a restaurant of their characteristics (high price).

Me and another friend came to us first last. Just when we were eating alone because my friends had already finished their first. We get the second one was a steak. I mean, you just fruit salad and when you take the steak was already cold. Excuse-me about you, but I do not pay 23 euros for a steak of those features. Those who ate seafood told me it was frozen.

It is a very cozy restaurant with a good treatment of the customer and offers a fairly extensive menu with more fresh produce and meat which appears as the main ingredient and others that prioritizes fish. In my case, I ordered a steak with vegetables. The meat was rich, made just grilled to a turn, very crispy outside and tender inside. It is a dish consisting of: 2 pieces of fairly large and significant churrasco, one halved potato baked in the oven 1 tomato and some cooked vegetables. For a modest price of 15 € approx. The price / quality ratio is excellent and ate super well. The total price per person was 15 € / person, and left the restaurant with a smile. Obviously, it is a family restaurant that could be considered to go a day or celebrating something but would not recommend for very romantic dates for the lack of light or more reserved and intimate space.","es","3.0"

Finally I would like to point out that we sat on the 2nd floor, in the downtown area. Of course, I would not recommend to anyone. Cheers,","es","1.0"

Overall both the service and the food were correct, although as I say in the title, for a 4 * in the center of Andorra, the breakfast food is not up to par, and dinner services were very irregular. 1. Breakfast it is not even for a 3 star, I must say. The meats and cheeses are good, but the Boyeria is something hard, and hot, well, things are not too hot. The omelette, directly was armed, tasteless and inedible concrete. At least the service and treatment of the waiters was excellent. 2. Dinner was irregular. Overall both the service and the food tasted good. Full and varied menu with traditional cuisine. They were up to the hotel, although expensive, and it cost € 25 per person. The service was irregular because the first and last night everything was perfect, while the second was a real Nightmare in the kitchen. It was Friday night and being mid-December coincided with several business lunches that were made in the halls of the hotel. The situation greatly exceeded them. For starters there was any employees who knew the little office of waiter and were wrong with the dishes, brought dishes that were not ... the worst thing is that one of the meter giving them fights in front of all customers. We got lucky with the dishes and we were fast, but other tables asked not to bring them the second, tired of waiting and left. Other tables were seated before us and when we left we were even the first. Especially the meter and restaurant waiter who looked after us the first and last night mention because we really got a very good deal and were attentive and very professional at all times, thanks to them and the quality of food at dinner the score is normal, if it would not be bad or good.","es","3.0"

"5634","Thinking that the Angelo pizza was not bad at all, we decided to try Angelo & Friends with some friends and we were hugely disappointed quite fat. We arrived early at the first turn of dining at night (at 20:30), we were alone on the premises and ordered the cards. They came right away to take note but you know that between friends (especially if you do not see months) and can not you talk straight to the point as when you have to eat fast to go to work; so we asked the waitress if we could leave a few minutes and his face was a bad poem, grimaced as if did not like. And we ask a group member does not speak Catalan or Castilian and the girl went to him all the time in Castilian, so we had to make ourselves interpreters. OK, coming quickly brought the salads, but they had better because it costs nothing to disburse a florette and add a couple of cherrys and a pair of white asparagus. Worse was to come. Upon completion next were waiting almost 30 minutes to be brought 2nd pizzas were 3/2 (2 are identical) and a burger. Well, when the 2 1/2 identical pizzas arrived on a plate they were all ingredients but no mass and another was missing and leftover dough ingredients. They did tell the waitress willingly and literally laughed at us saying it was not his fault. No apology even told myself ... Then I got up to get his attention and ask him please to ensure when you collect the dishes in kitchen and all the ingredients are very brazen again claiming it was not his fault hes back and ignored me completely. So my experience Angelo & Friends is really negative. You can also ask the gentlemen who sat at the table next to us, plates were missing and had come before other diners were already eating as part were wrong 2 times with his commands. Also last night did nothing to heat and air conditioning were placed on the premises. Summary: bad food, poor attention, poor organization and overpriced for what it is.","es","1.0"

We had a few beers, water and some specialty coffees and the final price was 40 €.

My mom gnocchi with 4 cheeses, my dad pizza with buffalo mozzarella, my brother a risotto with porcini mushrooms and I entrecote meat Andorran. My beef was fantastic, the pizza exactly what you eat in Naples and buffalo mozzarella here in Andorra is a dream, the risotto al dente and with real Parmesan cheese freshly grated.

We ordered chicken rice chicken but the course was pork, also ordered some kind of chicken nuggets, which again became greasy pig with a big layer of soft wet batter and disgusting. Never more!

He told us that when a child is crying or upset, the mother should get out of there (with the water that was falling) and stated that in other circumstances (with full dining) we would have missed the place.

And the return could not be better. In every dish a special touch of the chef Marco, making the high-quality exquisite shows. At all times the service was friendly and correct. The bright and airy and spotless clean room. We chose a la carte, first, to share, lobster salad with citrus and mi-cuit foie gras chutney. I recommend the salad for those who want to control their cholesterol and foie gras for those who do not mind a few extra calories :). Both dishes beautifully presented and more than adequate amount. The foie gras combines seven contrasts, each more fun! stressing to me, the popcorn. Second ask Hake cascade of flavors and loin confit cod, both tender and delicate flavor, fish was super fresh and as small flaw, cod was more tasty than they should pinch, but nothing that prevented enjoy their texture and quality. Recommended by Maître, we take a white wine QUINTA Apollonia, which combine perfectly with all dishes. The yoghurt mousse dessert closed a splendid lunch, we ended up with a coffee accompanied by a tree clouds of different flavors, very funny and original. The final ratio of money, we were surprised in a very positive and we look forward to returning to try the tasting menu. It is noteworthy that the xef was kind of approach to greet and discuss the dishes and even the Director of the Plaza, was so kind as to discuss with us our opinion and invite us to give our opinion to improve service.

It was a Sunday and, my two favorite restaurants in the area (Versailles, El Crosto) being closed, we headed to El Faisa located between. The small terrace is not more than the other local places and inside, small too, but with warm atmosphere is very inviting. By cons, mixed cramped and sinks are unworthy of this address because outside the walls in a narrow passage! There is no menu ... two, we chose a hearty garlic soup Alpujarreña (18 €). Excellent original tartiflette presented as lasagna but with a bare minimum (€ 22). A delicious cake with mascarpone and caramel (€ 7.5). An orange trench with a strawberry cut into four at the unbelievable price of € 3.5. A bottle of Raimat (abadia) at a fair price, it, of € 13.5 and 1/2 mineral water at € 2. One coffee espresso € 2 overpriced !!! In the end, not the traditional chupito de la casa. In short, with IVA € 71.58 (thats it, it is put Andorra) for a meal altogether commonplace where there is nothing to beat the c .. ground.

It is nice that the waitress will look bad by ordering a chicken dish, and unless you say chicken is grilled and is already eh? It is not an appropriate response to this type of restaurant. The sink, pathetic, at the bottom of the ladder neighborhood, unisex, not very clean. Nobody imagined a letter with those prices in a restaurant with this sink. The winery scarce and very expensive. Tables too close together for the price of the card, can barely move one person between the tables without disturbing the guests.

We waited until 22:30 until we were served the first dish on the menu (dish somehow call a seafood cocktail consisting of some lettuce with a prawn and a piece of pineapple and a splash of pink sauce over commercial ). We were lucky because we found a corkscrew on the table and we were able to open the bottle of wine, because other tables at 11:30 did not drink anything! At 23:00 they claimed the food or our money back and to calm us take one of the last dishes to share for both skipping the rest of dishes.

Of course they arrived at 22:00 had to wait ... At no time was the restaurants fault, but if some guests punctuality.

Yes the main course is OK but cod is a small flat with no explanations, I did not understand the egg at 61 degrees (poorly translated on the English map Franco) nor its gustatory interest. The desserts are almost nonexistent (ice or chocolate cake or mojito?). No dessert for me the meal is not complete. Another question I had: there were two errors in the command. The first was repaired and the second concerned the price of wine (19 € instead of 11 € ordered). Otherwise, a big thank you to our friendly server hyper.

I repeat: it took 15 minutes traerlos-, second both ordered mussels in sauce, this time it took 10 minutes (maybe a little more) to bring the main course ... (considering that if they have prepared is 1 min warm .. and if unprepared cooking time of a mussel is 3 minutes). mussels, I must admit they were good ... dessert cheese beaten with apple .. (Cheese shake we can find in any supermarket with baked apple slices) was good ... but nothing to rave about.

Food is typical of a kebab restaurant menus with potatoes, drink and kebab, nothing great but its not bad, its pretty good. I always ask the falafel, but also make Indian food, so yes, forever frozen, the style of this type of restaurant. Either way, Ill keep coming and I keep asking eating there or take away, because it is very well. The price is the same for all kebab, 7.50 euros A galette kebab, fries and drink, as elsewhere. What I really like are the sauces. And they serve well, especially the girl, although the owner is not far behind. Good food, fast and well priced.

Starter buffet very basic and banal. Chop entree (singular) of lamb, grilled piece consisting only of bones and fat, with a boiled potato and sliced 2 lettuce leaves without seasoning .... and dessert buffet or a piece of melon, a slice of pineapple and a lot flan were the main attractions. Plus water and 1 coffee for € 16 ... Its not worth the trip. I understand seeing the tail formed at the entrance, in a neighboring property for that price they had a feast. Furthermore Andorra la Vella is becoming a chic place to trendy shops and finally as expensive as in neighboring countries.

"6775","My wife and I stayed last weekend in Andorra and were looking after walking a while, a place to eat that half were well priced and with an acceptable menu. See, after rising by car and spend the Cadi tunnel where you dig and almost 12 € one way and as many back after spending gasoline, after shopping, what can you not do is get into some site 30 € menu for a decent salad or starter and a second hot and the same acceptable manner saucer. And you do not have time to roam around the village that the width is very short, but over is huge. With what we seek in the downtown area an average place price and a basic menu and this had for 11 € and then another peak of 14 € for the sake of wearing a steak, which I must say, was very Okay. Lack care for the issue of whether the first diners ask for a salad when they take the steak or anything else, because man, do not take them more fodder and put a garrison of more lettuce to the subject. 4 potatoes and let go as well, but hey, also a menu of 11 € and in a place like this can not ask for more. The correct menu, the waiters / as correct. A little professional touch is that if you see that you are going to pay by card, man, go for the machine and bring, do not order the card with the intent to take her to the counter. Average restaurant, overpriced for what you are eating menu. But the platters look good and the food is well made, it is good and the price and location, hand almost everything back again. The highlight here is not so much negative as criticism but as ideas for improvement and also for those contemplating optionally know what to eat, which is what one goes, eat well, food is not heavy and is all right. There are many more options but are very expensive. Incidentally, much talk of a free country in the Pyrenees where everything is cheap, but it is a fallacy, menus for the price of other alternatives to this, I do not know why they have smoked to have those prices. Better to take one pie plate or sandwich home to pay more than 15 euros for a menu that is not going to be worth. LIsard, at least you are consistent and you can eat average for less than 12 € which is fine.","es","3.0"

They served food even later and with outdated dishes; that is, they brought it to one, a half hour to another, and so all the time, so we had swelled to bread and potatoes dish girl.

The worst was mine to pay for a 21 and scallops with mushroom sauce, and if if was brik sauce and mushrooms exactly the same as those of the habitats !!!! dripping with red pepper oil, and tell me who came .The truth is that it was a disaster. The waiters fighting among themselves, drifters totals tables discussing things they asked. Well what we embarrassment. A fatal food at a price of 70 euros is amazing.

And he points out a table of two right next to the front door. As we are in December and Andorra makes a freezing cold, we asked whether another table as it is soon, and has several empty tables in the room. Here already changed the face of funny and seem to be offended. It tells us that the waiter has to assemble the tables (careful, it put two paper tablecloths and letter), and that a glass between the table and the door does not pass the cold. The truth is that the table is a foot from the entrance, and although there is a glass separator when someone enters or leaves a cold glacier air passes. We say we can expect to assemble the tables, to which he replies You yourself, and without even looking at his face and walks down the hall. About to go flipping the deal, the waiter serving us. He says it takes two minutes to mount the table, hopefully we, so we stayed. Next event: We ordered food, pasta dish with mushrooms and scrambled eggs. My partner asks glass of white wine. When the waiter brings the wine, we hesitate to say Do not know him, right? Well, its a wine bottle 27 € ¬_¬ anyway. The wine is good, but honestly, needless initial pedantry. A good wine is not measured by its price, waiter friend, which would discover in any blind tasting forgives you ... but at least you why you have served us well, not the edge of your partner. The justea food. Not exactly cheap, order the dish € 8-10 (although it is true that in that area not going to find anything cheaper). While pasta, eggs but also a piece of shell :( normalitas patatas bravas.

The general impression of the hotel - pretty good. Friendly staff at the reception. Accommodation: The rooms are neat, clean. But a closer look at the disadvantages become apparent. There is not a single battery for drying things (special room for drying shoes, too At least not) - when the slope is still necessary! The room is very, very cold. side window wind literally walks, central heating set to the maximum, but it did not help. At times, the barrel of ice there. night, I woke up from that aching shoulder, from which slipped a blanket ... In addition, we are constantly in the bathtub drowning neighbors above. We changed the room without problems at short notice. The hotel has a spa, a single visit for free. Sauna - Turkish hammam - a cold, but it can be wonderfully warm up in the hot tub. Service and staff: to the maids have no complaints, rooms are cleaned on time and in good faith; to the waiters, perhaps, no complaints, except one - more on that later! As for the kitchen - a single word! Breakfast buffet, we had breakfast and dinner included. The food was monotonous. Evenings were fed dried up (left over from last time) cheese, specifically cooked meals. On the last night there was a climax - we were served podtuhshie chicken legs. When we were told about this, head of the dining room (I do not know what there is in his position) - he said that the chicken is normal and does not stink, and we are fools. Without exaggeration - he gave us Naham and Russian-speaking girl at the reception was not able to resolve the conflict. On the side of the hotel no one stood up - thats a service! yet we had one story - I wanted to make breakfast a cup of hot tea in the room. I was not allowed to do this - honestly blocked the path of the same head of the dining room! I tried to explain that this tea for colds man who could not come down for breakfast. I tried to explain it, and Russian-speaking lady at the reception. useless! All the same old ham waving my arms and poked a finger! Excellent education and culture of the staff !!!

The burgers came 45 minutes into the salad to share, at 55. The vast majority of tables, only had the drink on the table and were on our same case. Long faces and customer dissatisfaction. Some ways Manager not very friendly. The quality ... deserves a separate chapter. The burger, it shows the league that is handmade, but at least mine, with meat and reheated the third time is a lot to take hours or maybe days and made only spent slightly before serving grilled showed. The accompanying sauce was pure and wasabi ... instead of being a wasabi mayonnaise that was softer and better combine with the meat. The salad, fine, but inadmissible that take 55 minutes for a salad. By charging, not one smile or apology. The chef and the manager, should be unemployed before they end up trashing the place.

Parts of the burgers were cold (examples: mushrooms, fried eggs and bacon). The potatoes had just arrived when and burgers (that if the buenisimas! Potatoes).

Meanwhile, waiters and the owner looked for the bar in the box, without serving customers. One time we take note, do not bring us drinks until we bring the first course. Also, we bring messy dishes. First burgers after a while potatoes. And, of course, they forgot a bottle of water we ordered. We turned to ask us not brought. It took over the account with the risotto and brought cold. We ask a waiter that we changed and more pampering, it took what it takes to finish the burger. So we asked them not to bring because we had all the girls finished unless they had left the risotto. In the bill, of course we were not charged the plate in the end we did not eat, but were charged water ever delivered. In addition, a cocky attitude on the part of the owner. In terms of food. A hamburger, such as the vegetable is acceptable. However the burger with pesto, is the most sad and poor burger Ive ever tasted: Pesto and mozzarella.

Unlike some comments Ive read, it did not take us too much. The waiter was very correct. And what surprised us most was the menu. 10 € (drinks not included) ate a risotto first, and second a hamburger. I thought it would be smaller than what was in the letter, but did not, and the burger was on the menu was the same one that you could choose from letter (which alone already cost 11 €). Honestly, I finished very busy and could not with dessert, but I was offered to change it for the coffee, which yes I accepted. As I say, do not expect anything gourmet, but as hamburger, leave the bar very high. Incidentally, in the bar quite a wide collection of gins to take a Gin Tonic looked ...

"7968","There is something that never fails when traveling: when a restaurant has more customers own place tourists is a good sign. And that is what led us to try your luck at The Burger Lounge, a small but tastefully decorated burger that is on the third floor of the Illa Carlemany shopping center in the same street where all the shops. Before entering you can read the letter, see the products they have and check prices, and to me that is critical as you know in advance what you are getting before you sit. Therefore, before you dispose you enter you know that hamburgers are 200 grams, the meat is 100% veal Andorra and the price ranges of about 10 euros a hamburger. I have to say that the service was quick and efficient and well organized as we arrived on a Saturday at peak times and still did not have to wait long and to sit, or to order, or to start eating. Hamburgers for my taste are delicious: the meat is very juicy and tender, is seen to be a quality product, and there are many varieties and combinations to suit all tastes (and even depends burger you ordered is likely costing you finish ). They also offer other dishes like carpaccio and salads, and then there are accessories and various kinds of potatoes among which are the wild. We decided to try the latter and for my taste are not the best and by far: a tacos, with the mayonnaise and salsa aside which is not the best- (and I say, you are a fan of the wild). To drink no soda, reeds, jars, bleeding and even the possibility of ordering a glass of wine (which if I remember correctly is the cup to 3.20 € and is not to be very generous with the amount). So says local information are not only specialists but also burgers Gin-Tonic. I had the chance to try them, but surely will have occasion to do when I return to Andorra. It took a while to find this place, but I liked the quality and know I will repeat. In short: an option to consider to eat quickly but without haste and with good value in the same shopping street.","es","4.0"

Pasta, sauce watery and with little, very tasteless dish. The breaded fish was frozen, and bad. Also quite dry and accompanied by rice, also dry.

The drink which is not included and also to a normal price. We will come back!","fr","4.0"
