5,Emergency room volunteers and medical staff are all very professional and caring. ICU staff are caring and candid too. Hospital staff do their best to meet patient and family's wish. Giving us tip on how to care for the patient and items that they need to stay overnight.
5,This place is amazing! They treated my friend who speaks no Chinese so kindly and patiently and made sure that she had everything she needed during her stay. Also the food court is like no other hospital food court I have ever seen! I would totally recommend this hospital if you need to go to one.
5,"I have the privilege of being part of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital and it's world class service. It is a pioneer in medical treatment and has an unmatched medical service. Personally I have the honor to be part of the prestigious Orthopaedic Oncology team as visiting fellow and every day that goes by I continue to be amazed at the hard work and meticulous study of our patients. Taiwan is lucky to have such an wonderful hospital full of dedicated and hard working personnel, and I am truly blessed to be a part of it."

2,"In the surgical referral, plastic surgery is performed on plastic surgery. Even if the director is given a knife, it is not recommended. The surgery will cause infection, and the wound will be red. On the day of the consultation, the patient will be hospitalized and listened to the debridement surgery. I am glad that the situation is not serious, the wound is not enlarged, and the meat can be kept. It¡¦s hard to imagine the torment, and the doctor only said faintly that I don¡¦t want to do this... What is even more bizarre is that after the hospitalization, the same situation is found in the next bed friend. The same doctor on the same day is even more suspicious and mixed. I did not expect that a small operation such as a lipoma in a large hospital would cause such a big nightmare. Originally it is 0 hearts, it will give 2 hearts, and one will give a few careful and patient caregivers. Even if it comes to support, it will make people feel embarrassed. Another heart is to give down the food street downstairs. There are many kinds of food to eat, there are also squid soup suitable for patients to eat, and fruit juice... Save the inconvenience of going out for food. There were more ants and cockroaches in the ward of the Zhongzheng Building."
1,"The emergency waiter is better at a better attitude. I know how busy people are, but I don't owe you money. Is this the tone? Ok, I will give you respect. I have to take a blood test for the urine. I havent said anything. I just ignored it. I have a fever and I am very faint. I will know clearly how to go? You are not allowed to go out to eat in the emergency department. Are you responsible for starving? If I didn't bring my family to starve to death, what is it, I am suffering from AIDS? Will it be transmitted to outside people? Could it be that you buy a lunch? What logic, the three armies are more than this, pull, joke, I want to seek to solve the problem but do this, the fever has been burned and ignored, everything comes by myself? I am not coming to the street, I am a patient, I will deal with serious illness first. Forget the little illness, at least come and care! Or give a fever, press it, it will burn up to 40 degrees. Is it a problem? Are you responsible? ? No matter what, if you have a fever, would you like someone to help? Other hospitals are going to deal with it once, once, once, here? We have to ask us to check it out. No matter whether you have a fever or not, you will not be given a fever medicine or help you to take your body temperature at any time. Then I will faint. There are so many differences with the private hospitals, you are very powerful, and there are not enough people to take care of the next few seconds, isn¡¦t it? Please give me an answer!"
5,"Gynecologist Hong Huancheng is very kind, patient and patient, and he is also very good at medical treatment. He can be considerate about any gynecological disease. Her personal care nurse, Ms. Lai Manrong, is more careful and often masters the details of the patient. When the doctor is not available, she rests her time to comfort the patient's physical condition and makes our patients feel warm. Thanks to my doctor Dr. Hong Huancheng and the specialist nurse, Ms. Lai Manrong. Another person who is warmer is a trainer, Miss Li Narong. She often touches all patients. In addition to caring for the patient to greet the patient carefully, she is willing to fight for any help to the patient. As long as the patient needs her, she also Can appear next to you, thank you all for your contribution"
1,"My girlfriend is going to have a wrist surgery today. I have to be hospitalized for three days. On the first day of the day, I have to put a needle in the hospital ward. The male nurse will not hurt others when I dont have an injection. I always say that the blood vessels are too thin. Broken, the hand is already very painful to resist, want to say that he is very young, the intern will give him a chance.Later, I changed it to another place and poked it. The more I poked the deeper, I really said that my girlfriend was in the pig skin and said that I could not find the blood vessel. Otherwise, it means that the blood vessel is too fine to be broken? The needle is fishing inside, I dont know what to fish in. My girlfriend is a pain-reliant person. In the end, I was really unable to bear it. It hurts to cry for an hour, so there is no such nurse next to the dish. People are watching, just like people as white mice?In the end, I didnt even have an apology. I said that if you take a break and then the person disappears, the distance has been separated by a needle for 5 hours. Now the hand is still very swollen and painful. Two places are poked, one is left. A little bit of pain is probably a little bit more painful than usual, and the other is really painful. I don't know if it will be good tomorrow. Now I am completely swollen!We are a double ward. The aunt next door is also inserted several times by him. Looking at the ceiling, the aunt does not need to leave a needle. He left the needle in the hand of the aunt for a short time. Another nurse said, ""Auntie. The needle has to be pulled out and the needle has been forgotten!""Later, I changed to another nurse and told my girlfriend to leave the needle after the needle was left. I had to take out the nail and remove the nail polish. Because I can't rub the nail polish after the knife is opened, we have reviewed it before we opened the knife. The doctor did not mention it at all. This thing, maybe most of the people are like this, but not most of them are like a girl like my girlfriend who is swollen with a big bag and can¡¦t do it, and then I will give you a dummy. Then, with a painful dying, take the needle to remove the armor? In the end, my girlfriend was really hurt because the hand was inserted by the rookie. He said that he should not open the knife. We just did not open the knife, and then went home with the hand of the white mouse, and paid 520 pieces. Registration fee"
5,"Due to the fracture of the family, the hospital has more contacts with Rong. I feel that the people working here, regardless of doctors, nurses, volunteers, service, etc., have almost achieved ""visual illness"" and are willing to listen and give More assistance. Although the area is large and complex, and the food street has a lot of thunder food, it is a great choice to receive treatment here."
1,"Doctors who hang the name of Tang, often do not consult, and this time they borrowed a temporary meeting and changed people. Then why should I hang this waiting for so long? It¡¦s awful, I won¡¦t hang this doctor again in the future."
5,"Dr. Huang Weiming's heart failure clinician's father was still able to see him when he was hospitalized! Today, the emergency room doctor is helping my father to change his urinary attitude very well! Keep going"
2,"The doctors who have been seen by Taipei Rongzhong are very skilled and very grateful! But at the end of May last year, when the production was in Taipei, the delivery room encountered a super white-looking nursing staff (wearing short-sighted eyes), and the mothers were already in the process of giving birth. The process of anxiety and nervousness of Baby began to hurt. The result: this white-eyed nursing staff also rushed in to ask maternity, personal physical problems (not related to production problems), just to satisfy their curiosity, to show that they seem to understand medical professional! Very unreasonable, sympathetic delivery room care staff! Fortunately, the next day when the morning is just about to be produced, the nurses who work in shifts are very good! I can only say that this is not the same sympathy, spying on the private privacy of the maternity, the unethical nursing staff is really a mouse cockroach of the total maternity nursing team, really not worthy of being a nursing staff! Very bad wicked behavior!"

5,"Oral surgery experience in tooth extractionThe reason why I will go to the big hospital to see the doctor is because the general clinic can't handle it, so I am willing to wait patiently to wait in line.I made a braces 8 years ago after root canal in the general dentist's office. I am currently examining the root-zone lesions of cellulitis. I am going to a neighboring dentist's office to check that the diagnosis is cellulitis. The clinic wants me to go to the big hospital.I came to Rong and slowly learned that the dental surgery has been divided into many departments and I understand it slowly. After a few doctors' advice, this tooth can't escape the tooth extraction.Today, it is Lei Wentian, the attending physician of tooth extraction. He patiently explained the signs of this tooth, which made me feel very professional. At the same time, I also confirmed with me the situation of playing anesthesia. My emotions are inevitable, but my emotions are inevitable. In order not to affect the doctor's work mood, I also do a good job in the patient's part, and wait until everything is ready before starting to extract. The doctor pressed the tool and applied pressure. I didn't feel any pain. It didn't take long for the teeth to be pulled out. Then I cleaned the roots and the doctors explained the precautions after the tooth extraction. I took the gauze and took the medicine and went home. I didn't feel very painful about this process.Thanks to Dr. Lei Wentian for his patient explanation and let me get relief in the process."
5,"Jiang Lulu doctor in the chest is really a good doctor of benevolence and benevolence. Not only does it make my husband's tumor smaller, but also the patients who are late for the visit are afraid that we will not be able to come to the gastrointestinal department and ask the nurse to help us first. Calling the past and asking them to wait, it¡¦s really a big thank you."
4,"Medical resources, human resources, first-class hospitals, but traffic conditions are the biggest cover."
1,"My attending physician, Li Qiuyang, has a good medical skill. Every time he finds a vascular problem, he can solve it. He is also very responsible. He came to the patrol room to find out my surgical wound yesterday. The nurse was temporarily removed by dialysis, and the kidney was washed at noon. When I wrap it up, he will ask the nurse why he didn't pack it. From this point, he can see his re-examination of the patient and the medical treatment. On the other hand, the nurse on duty at night is waiting to be strengthened. My stomach hurts from 9 o'clock and hurts. Sweat, press the bell to ask the nurse to come, and ask the doctor on duty to come and look at it. His diagnosis is flatulence. I told him that my past experience was acute gastroenteritis. According to his method, the injection is not effective and continues to hurt. I sweated all over the body, told the nurse at 12 o'clock in the evening, I came to the injection at 12:45, and it hurt for nearly four hours. This is still Rongye! I took a needle in the emergency room outside the small hospital for an emergency. It was comfortable for an hour. I was so guilty for four hours. I really don't know how to say it!"
3," The score is the same as that of the slide, and the step backwards is also. In particular, patients in the emergency room are hospitalized, like psychiatric patients, who will not have emotions - what is the feelings of the seven emotions? People dictate, the hospital is not a vegetable market, say buy and buy, you must first see the goods and then bid, Do not apply the needle. The same is true for the blood draw report, and the ward refuses to allow the attending physician to consult.Some employees are from the CCTV entertainment circle - the social work room, like the name is Chen Huiwen, famous for dress and high-rooted shoes, control the public's right to seek medical care, detain the amount of social welfare of the people, and have the habit of forging documents. Beitou 818 Hospital is Dr. Yang Yunian."

3,"Well-known Rong, the hardware equipment is good, but some doctors and nurses in the emergency department are not very good. Most people who come to the hospital are uncomfortable, sick or injured.

The presidents are all at this special level and come to the hospital for a diagnosis or need. The medical treatment equipment is equipped with the world's strongest strength of the top medical treatment drugs or inspections. Every need is very high. Every survey shows that the comprehensive medical treatment drugs are rich in variety and many service bases. It can be said that it is worthy of the best place to listen to the perfect heart.

Thank you very much."

I don't understand the attitude. What is the difference? What is your qualification? I don¡¦t know if I can go directly to the emergency department. Is it a day to go to the appointment clinic to call to ask if you can be considerate?"

1,"This is the worst hospital I have ever seen. Not only are the quality of the staff poor, but the volunteers are also awkward. It takes half an hour for the doctor to come and not to report in advance. The efficiency is poor, the person is poor, and the perception is poor."
3,"Because the original ultrasound time of the abdomen on September 21 was temporary, I changed the ultrasonic time by telephone at 8:45 am on September 4, and the medical staff who answered the phone were very impatient, arrogant attitude, using the identity card. The font size is not enough, you must have a medical record number.For patients, self-righteous attitudes are actually unorthodox. From the standpoint of medical staff, this is a very unprofessional behavior. The hospital should strengthen the training of personnel service attitudes.

2,"I advise you not to go to the big hospital unless it is really a complicated disease. Because it is only for the three months of hospitalization, I can wait for three months. I am a patient of Rong, who said that I have to arrange the results of the hospitalization in the beginning of June. I don't know how long it will take until I am really sick. Please go to the clinic and leave space for us with complicated patients. Please."
2," The nursing staff and the doctor feel very good, the restaurant has also taken the food street style, with a sense of planning and design.But the inpatient ward is really bad. The wall inside the room is mottled with the table. It feels the same as the old hotel. When the toilet opens, I see 4 or 5 Xiaoqiang running around. At night, the walls and corners of the room are also small and strong. Silly eyes can't sleep well.In the afternoon, I checked, 11 o'clock nurses came to prepare, 11:30 to check outside, waiting for 12 o'clock, but saw a bunch of medical staff take the lunch and go to the examination room.

Now, at 9 o'clock, only the 7th is seen. Will the 31th have to wait until the old people can stand it?To change the mode of operation, it should be more patient and patient, rather than an impatient reply.

Convenient, generally see a doctor in the third clinic,"
1,"Most, professional, no medical ethicsI know that medical staff are very hard, but I hope there is basic empathy; caring and passion.I have never been to Jung Jung before. Some people are very poor because of the first referral.Miss Lu who was hospitalized at 1.17F may be too busy to appreciate the hard work of the medical staff. However, she did not listen to the needs of the patient and interrupted the patient's right to speak.2. The single parent family is very bad, and preoperative hospital examination is not necessary... so the hospitalization and examination fees are confirmed again and again, but the tone is very bad.

1,"The difference between the systems, if you want to have a good rest at 11 o'clock in the evening, you still have to gamble to look at the character, otherwise you have to wear a black face and tear your face with your neighbor. It is best to let the patient rest, and the single ward wants the patient. If you have a good rest, it will be like an old man.

1,"(Translated by Google) The mainland caregivers of the Zhongzheng Building 121 Ward have a very bad attitude. The old Rongmin people who have no family members are really pathetic. Their lives cannot be taken care of by the caretaker. My brother is still in hospital and I often listen to him. She shouted at the old north and the north next to her and snored her voice. At that time, she had to record a little chicken to see how long she could squat. Her face was stinking, and the sound of the bed rails crashed. I didn't understand that she was unhappy. What, if the dean, and vice president Chen Weiming, should continue to use this kind of unreasonable person to work in a Taiwan hospital, then congratulations to you, and it will be very soon. Ms. Zhang Yuzhen, who is not without good medical staff 121 wards, is very nice and patient. She is really sick. Fortunately, there are always such good nurses in Rongrong.

5,"The problems with teeth can sometimes be far more complicated than most people can imagine. Very fortunate to see the experience of several users to share, so that they are at their fingertips, have the opportunity to go to the Northern Territories endodontics for treatment.Because I had no previous knowledge about pulp disease, there was no previous pain in my fillings, and I learned later that the nerves may be inflamed, even though the appearance and even the radiographs seem to fill or intact teeth The case of necrosis, but after filling teeth will be more painful or more serious inflammation.Knowing the medical information of Bei Rong's endodontics department, the teeth that have been replenished are no longer pain but also grow pustules. Since the appearance of the teeth and the X-ray before the pustule look good, even in the case of severe pain in a few teeth Many times a month to seek medical advice, most doctors said that no further observation and treatment, may therefore lose the opportunity to complete treatment before the nerve necrosis. Finally, Bei Rong after several months of root canal treatment, even after a few months after root canal sealing pustule still not eliminated, but also accepted the apical resection surgery, very grateful to Feng Yuxian physicians intentions of treatment.In its own example to share with you, if the teeth make up but there is a painful situation, when the doctor blindly only to observe and not to deal with treatment, or can only be unplugged, you can choose to hospital dental pulp disease If there is any other way of handling the specialist examination, it may be possible for you to feel less painful and the treatment process may be much shorter."
1,"Where the father left, the hospitalized medical staff asked one after another, and asked the doctor to skip the illness. He changed the three doctors as if he were playing the ball. No one took over the hand when we met the doctor. It was when we met the attending doctor that we took over from the past and clearly asked questions. Ten days before my father left, the attending doctor only told them all about the illness, and it was still hopeless to tell us about his father's condition. During this period, we always asked us not to care about us.It can only be said that medical workers are now afraid of being reported by their families for self-protection. They would rather be silent. Schools only teach practical matters. They lack education in empathy and humanitarian relations and communication and education. They do not want medical staff to be enthusiastic about patients, but they hope they can do more. A basic message, do not be silent, family members do not have to guess chaos suspicion, nor is all family members are not rational, only silently do not inform, there will be irrational family members, hope that medical care can have more and family communication and communication, Even ten minutes of delays in medical care will result in the understanding of the family's patients. Dad still wants to live. It's only too sudden. The doctor has always avoided the real problems and the general situation does not speak. In the end, my dad was unclear and only came to tell us about the illness. My dad didn't have time to explain anything and left.Although there are good doctors, although doctors do not harm people, but some doctors are afraid of being reported by irrational family members, so they choose not to tell them why they are afraid of the defendant.Knowing that not all health care workers are like this, but a bad meal, a stain destroys a piece of white paper.I really hope that the health education school can provide additional education about what it is to tell and what it means to communicate. It should not be that doctors and doctors are sick of each other. Medical doctors are afraid of medical reports, and they are afraid of medical treatment.I didn't want to tell the doctor. I didn't tell the doctor because I knew the doctor wouldn't harm people. It was just that the doctor had less direct communication and the patient's family did not understand. So my dad left with the doctor's mistakes. . I'm sorry my dad couldn't do a good job diligently asking the doctor to let you know what happened to you and let you leave in a bit of annoyance, hoping you can come back, as if you were all right. This is not true.Dad, I'm sorry, I really love you. . . ."
